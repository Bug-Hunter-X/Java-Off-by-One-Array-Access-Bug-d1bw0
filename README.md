# Java Off-by-One Error

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array. The bug causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` because the loop attempts to access an index beyond the array's bounds.

The `bug.java` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of carefully considering loop conditions when working with arrays in Java.
